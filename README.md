# discord-bot-spammer
a discord.py app that uses a bot to raid / spam a server. i made this in october but now everyone has their own bot so no point in gatekeeping lmao


how to use:

make a permissionless bot scope, add it to your server, click on the bots profile, add to my app, then use the command (/spam message ammount) in any server that has it enabled.
